### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Robotics Software Engineer passionate about building autonomous systems that work in the real world. I specialize in perception, motion planning, and control using ROS/ROS2, C++, and Python. My work spans integrating industrial arms and AMRs into production pipelines, with a focus on SLAM, computer vision (PyTorch/TensorFlow), and scalable software architecture. I enjoy turning complex robotics problems into clean, efficient, and reliable solutions.
